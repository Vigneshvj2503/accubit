Hi Anand,
 
If we go with Snapshot approach then, Below changes are required on Kafka and ZK machines.
 
## Common changes/points on both Kafka and Zookeeper
1) /etc/hosts file should be changed on all the machines
2) Remove data directories on the snapshot
3) Machine should be brought up in the following order (KDC Primary,KDC Slave,Zookeeper[1,2,3], Kafka[1,2,3]))
 
## Kafka Config files which requires hostname related change if we go with snapshot approach
1) server.properties
2) mm-consumer.properties
3) mm-producer.properties
4) kafka_jaas.conf
 
## Keytabs to be copied on Kafka machines under /etc/security/keytabs/
1) kafka.keytab (This has to be copied from KDC primary system)
2) mirrormaker.keytab (We have to get this keytab from Axton team)
 
## Zookeeper Config files which requires hostname related change if we go with snapshot approach
1) zoo.cfg
2) jaas.conf
3) /nyl/data/zk/data/myid (This file should have the numbers 1 or 2 or 3 on different ZK machines)
 
## Keytabs to be copied on Zookeeper machines under /etc/security/keytabs/
1.	zookeeper.keytab (This has to be copied from KDC primary system)
